# Hotlanta Blogs  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
    
## Description

This is a blogging site for those people who absolutely adore the hot, long nights in the ATL to share their experiences and such. This helps reduce the friction inherent in finding people of like interests to communicate with.I learned that there's a lot more to blogging sites than I first thought! This was a big project, with a lot more improvement available.
